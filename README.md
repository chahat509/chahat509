The title of my project is Login system.
It allows the users to register and login. After a user has registered, a "u have successfully registered" alert will show on the screen. then to login,
the user has to enter his/her email and password. After successfully logging in, a welcome screen shows. A user can logout and then login as many times he/ she wants. If the email is not registered, a "this email has not been registered"alert shows. This login system can be used for various websites and apps; for example, instagram, snapchat etc.
I used a combination of HTML, MYSQL, PYTHON, BOOTSTRAP, JAVASCRIPT, and FLASK.
